Most useful shortcuts which I use everyday.

* ⌃ + C: Clear line or quit running process (script, server)
* ⌃ + D: Kill the current process
* ⌃ + A: Go to the beginning of line
* ⌃ + E: Go to the end of line
* ⌃ + L: Same as `clear`. Clear the screen by moving the cursor down
* ⌘ + K: Clear the screen completely
* Tab: Autocomplete command or file/folder names

⌃ — Ctrl, ⌘ — Command.

Enabling `Use Option as Meta key` allows you to use Option key to navigate through words as in default text area.
