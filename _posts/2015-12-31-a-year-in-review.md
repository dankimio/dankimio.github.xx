title: 2015 – A Year In Review
date: 2015-12-31
description: Highlights of the year
---

## Code
- A lot of Ruby development, Rails APIs mostly
- A few web and iOS side projects (that I hope will be finished in 2016)
- 1700 commits on GitHub. If all my projects were open-source, I would be in [Top-200](http://git.io/top) of most active GitHub users.

## Movies
I watched 70 movies in 2015. Too bad, because that's 30 movies less than in 2014.

My personal favorites of 2015 are:

- Youth
- Mad Max: Fury Road
- Star Wars: The Force Awakens
- The Martian
- And I am still about to watch `Inside Out`, `The Bridge of Spies` and other movies.

## TV Shows
I prefer to watch as few TV shows as possible, but quality ones.

The favorite TV series of 2015:

- Gravity Falls. The final episode is still to be announced, but even now I can already tell how this series broke all my expectations. Definitely 10/10.
- Fargo – 10/10.
- Game of Thrones – 10/10 (as usual).
- Rick and Morty – 9/10.

## Books
2015 was the busiest year I ever had in my life. In the beginning of the year I set a goal on Goodreads to read 50 books in 2015. Only managed to reach the half of the goal though. I mostly read classics this year, also a lot of programming-related books. In 2016, however, I plan to add some variety: business, science fiction, fantasy etc. The Martian by Andy Weir was the favorite book of 2015. Read it first if you plan to watch the movie.

## Traveling
This year I visited the Netherlands. I realized that this is probably the place where I want to live and work in. Read my [Amsterdam](/photos/amsterdam) post for more details, I also plan to publish the photos from Rotterdam and The Hague.

## Photography
I decided to learn photography before my Netherlands trip. I got an old DSLR the day before the flight and I didn't know how to use one. I had little time to read the manuals during the flight. I struggled with the camera a lot: it was a real challenge to get the right focus or to set the proper focal length.

In the second half of the trip I switched to iPhone camera which is really smart and allowed me to take some great pictures but it's much worse in low light conditions. The other reason for this switch was the weight: DSLR weighs 1.3kg whereas my iPhone is just a hundred grams, after a few hours of walking my neck started to hurt.

Once I got home I realized how terrible my pictures were: I shot most of the pictures with the default (lowest) focal length and the lens had terrible barrel distortion at that focal length. I didn't set up my autofocus properly: it focused using the center AF-point and it took the camera a few seconds to focus, that was annoying. And the most terrible mistake: I didn't shoot RAW. I was constrained when I was fixing all awful things caused by the lack of photography skills. Lesson learned.

## Music
Top albums:

- Blurryface by twenty one pilots. The discovery of the year. There's no genre that fits into their music, the music that makes you think, the variety of styles amazes. Actually, this is the first album that I liked completely (I mean all songs).
- Magnifique by Ratatat
- Gold Shadow by Asaf Avidan
- Art Angels by Grimes

I also picked up a ukulele this year. Heavily inspired by twenty one pilots and Tyler Joseph. So, maybe I'll record a few covers the next year.

## Podcasts
- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex). CGP Grey and Myke Hurley discuss productivity (and many other things as well). There's nothing special in the podcast but it's just so interesting to listen to, that it has become my favorite. Definitely recommend.
- [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar). I stopped listening to Accidental Tech Podcast because the episodes were too long (up to 2 hours), very few development related topics and I just didn't have time to listen. I was already listening to Developer Perspective by David Smith: I really liked the format of short 15 minute episodes. And then Under the Radar comes out: just 30 minutes of developer-related talks from David Smith and Marco Arment. Perfect.
- If could recommend just one episode it would be The Developer on Fire episode – [The Pareto Principle and Stoic Philosophy with David Heinemeier Hansson](http://developeronfire.com/Podcast/Episodes/david-heinemeier-hansson-the-pareto-principle-and-stoic-philosophy).
