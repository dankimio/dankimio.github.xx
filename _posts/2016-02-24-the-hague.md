The Hague (Den Haag in Dutch) is the capital of South Holland and the seat of the Dutch government and Dutch royal house, it is the third largest city in the Netherlands.

Surprisingly, but you can get to The Hague by metro from Rotterdam (the second largest city in the Netherlands) by paying a regular fee and it is just a 40 minute ride.
