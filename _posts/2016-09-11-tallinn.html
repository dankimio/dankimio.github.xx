    I arrived in Tallinn on a very foggy day. This is what made the city look more beautiful and mysterious. Doesn't work in place where I come from, alas.

    I arrived in Tallinn by bus from Riga which is a 4-hour ride for €20. The city was much smaller than I expected and still I wish I had more time to walk around the streets.

    Tallinn is famous for its' Old Town which is located on a hill. Most of the buildings are preserved from the medieval time. It becomes more fascinating after realizing that the country was a part of the Soviet Union.

    The Old Town is divided into two parts: the upper town Toompea and the lower town All-linn.

    There are a lot of small shops and there's a market right behind the castle walls.

    You can find modern buildings just outside the Old Town. I love it when there's strong contrast of different eras. And the farther you go from the centre the more the city resembles a typical Russian city: five-storey panel houses are almost everywhere.
